# Area-of-cuboid-
Today 15 December, this is my second python code. 

lenght = int(input("lenght of cuboid is : "))
breath = int(input("breath of cuboid is : "))
height = int(input("height of cuboid is : "))
area = 2 * (lenght*breath + breath*height + height*lenght)
print("Area of cuboid is : ", area)
